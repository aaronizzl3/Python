# Python - What is this?
 
 Hi everyone,
 
 This is going to be a general repository for Python programming. Instead of leaving a raft of resources across my computer, laptop and VLEs, I thought it would be a lot better to store them all in one place. Hence the creation of this repository.
 
 I plan on leaving solutions, exercises and examples in here, alongside any other projects that have been worked on within classes that I think you would find useful.
