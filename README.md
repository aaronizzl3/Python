# Python - What is this repository used for?
 
 Hi everyone,
 
 This is going to be a general repository for Python programming. Instead of leaving a raft of resources across my computer, laptop and VLEs, I thought it would be a lot better to store them all in one place. Hence the creation of this repository, which can be utilised by any of my students (or anyone for that matter) as a reference point for code.
 
 I plan on leaving solutions, exercises and examples in here, alongside any other projects that have been worked on within classes that I think you would find useful.
